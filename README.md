# hubitat-bond
BOND Home Integration for Hubitat. This currently supports both fireplaces and fans.
 
## Fans
Fans currently support on/off, speed settings, direction, and lights (both a single light and up/down lights). Currently dimmers are not supported.
 
## Fireplaces
Fireplaces currently support on/off (which can also be optionally monitored by a power meter), fan speed settings, and a light.

## Devices
You must install all of the device drivers for the integration to work properly.
* BOND Fan
* BOND Fan Light
* BOND Fan With Direction
* BOND Fireplace
* BOND Fireplace Fan
* BOND Fireplace Light

## Apps
The BOND Home Integration app is what actually communicates with the BOND Hub device. This relies on the BOND Home Local API which is only available in the v2 BOND Home firmware.

### Configuration
To connect to the API you will need to specify the IP address of your BOND Hub and the access token. If you have the v2 app you can obtain the token by going to the Hub device in the app, then copy the _Local token_ value.

You will see the list of devices available from your hub on the next screen. Select the devices you wish to integrate.

If you chose any fireplaces and you have power meters setup, you will optionally be able to associate a power meter with the fireplace. This can be used to detect on/off status more reliably than BOND can (IR/RF aren't always the most reliable). You can then set a mimimum threshold for the power meter to detect that it is on.

## Limitations
* Only supports a single BOND hub per app installation
* Shades are not supported
* Fan light dimmers are not supported
